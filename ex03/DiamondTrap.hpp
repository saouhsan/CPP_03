	- "diamond problem‚Äù: multiple inheritance where a derived class inherits from
		two or more base classes that have a common base class.
	- C++ provides virtual inheritance. Itensures that the derived class has only
		one instance of the common base class, which is shared by all derived classes.
	- This ensures that the derived class does not inherit duplicate copies of the
		common base class, thus resolving the diamond problem.

	- Here DiamondTrap inherit from FragTrap & ScavTrap both of which inherit from
		ClapTrap
		Virtual makes sure that DiamondTrap has only one instance of ClapTrap
